What is BitCash?
By combining the advantages of cryptocurrency (speed, privacy, decentralization, low fees) 
with traditional fiat banking systems (transaction records, account names, electronic statements, 
accounting software integration) BitCash is the world’s first truly decentralized cryptocurrency 
designed to facilitate real world trade between consumers and merchants with a goal of becoming 
the world’s most used cryptocurrency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcash Core software, see https://choosebitcash.com.
